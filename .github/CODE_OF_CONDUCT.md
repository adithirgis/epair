# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributers pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others, being respectful of all viewpoints or opinions, and giving and accepting constructive feedback.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include the use of sexualized language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, public or private harrassment, publishing others' private information without permission, or any other conduct which could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.


## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement by contacting one of the maintainers. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
