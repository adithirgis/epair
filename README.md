A package designed to aid in getting data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) API at
https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.

### Overview

R users trying to get pollutant data from the EPA website can get easily discouraged. Needing to have a strong understanding of API’s, navigating json files, and a hefty load of parameter codes contribute to this sense of unease.

Our package, epair, waves these difficulties away.

The `epair` package helps you determine what data you want and how to get that data from the EPA API.
It provides loaded in variables that help you navigate services in the API, and a simple way to query the data. A comprehensive tutorial for using `epair` can be found at https://epair.netlify.app/. 

Users new to how API’s work may want to start with the Anatomy of an API request. Otherwise, installing the package and following the setup instructions will get you started.
